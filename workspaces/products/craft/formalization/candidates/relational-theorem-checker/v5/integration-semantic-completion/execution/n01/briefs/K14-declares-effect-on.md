K14 — relation.declares-effect-on

Status: candidate meaning; actual owner assessment pending.

Source question: Which exact governance effect does this Decision declare?

Source effect: Records admission, adoption, or authorization as separate effect values and executes none of them.

Proposed claim tier: recorded declared effect.

Independent witness type: `DecisionDeclaration`.

The exact source declaration and its ordered pairs are bound by [the definition contract](/home/vlad_/projects/CyberAlchemy-lab/craft/formalization/candidates/relational-theorem-checker/v5/integration-semantic-completion/definitions/K14-declares-effect-on.json).

**Independent meaning constraints**

- Exact kind/source definition and approved meaning revision.
- Exact source/target node kinds and revisions match one declared ordered pair.
- Every required qualifier has its independently defined typed interpretation; closed qualifier object has no extra field.
- Primary witness, subject, target, context, scope, source snapshot, epoch and time domain agree with the complete frame.
- The selected evidence and provenance policy establishes the claimed recorded/as-of/executed/observed posture; missing authenticity is not manufactured.
- decision = s; its selected declaration addresses t = exact_target_version_ref.
- effect_kind is exactly admission, adoption or authorization in the owned declaration policy; the values remain separate.
- The decision declaration is independent of any later application/execution receipt.

**Qualifiers**

| Field | Proposed type | Exact role |
|---|---|---|
| effect_kind | LegacyF0LiteralMeaning | record.effect: one separate admission/adoption/authorization value |
| exact_target_version_ref | LegacyF0LiteralMeaning | target.revision: exact declared target revision, with target kind and owner preserved |

**Effect**

Append the selected governance-effect declaration for t; execute no effect and infer no other effect value.

Append one exact immutable witnessed relation record, or idempotently retain an identical existing revision; same revision with different content is refused.

A record append does not implement its source witness's execution. Materialization requires evidence of a completed authorized atomic application; no standalone relation row proves it.

**Worked positive model**

Decision D declares adoption of T while admission and authorization remain absent and D has not been applied.

This is a candidate model blueprint. No actual approval or execution is established by the example.

**Worked refusal**

An adoption declaration cannot discharge an authorization challenge.

**Exact excluded conclusions**

- `relation.declares-effect-on:forbidden:0` — **effect-execution**: A verified completed transaction applies this declared effect to the exact target. Participants: the exact endpoint or output/action explicitly joined by this relation's primary witness; specification, decision, environment and execution are separate exact owned references.
- `relation.declares-effect-on:forbidden:1` — **cross-effect-inference**: A distinct governance declaration exists for other != declared; an admission/adoption/authorization value cannot produce the other values by itself. Participants: source Decision, exact target, the declared effect_kind and a distinct other EffectCode.
- `relation.declares-effect-on:forbidden:2` — **runtime-success**: An actual runtime execution satisfies every owned success criterion. Participants: the exact endpoint or output/action explicitly joined by this relation's primary witness; specification, decision, environment and execution are separate exact owned references.

Each exclusion needs a checked valid countermodel. The excluded property can still hold through independent evidence; the local relation does not decide its universal falsity.

Required source refinement: Under exact owned catalog/frame well-formedness, decoding and resolution of raw source fields yields a iff the independently specified source constraints denote Meaning_K14(W,a). The decoder/checker must not define that source predicate.

Required proofs:

- Prove the independent meaning has a valid positive model.
- Prove each exact qualifier mapping and checker/meaning equivalence.
- Prove declared record effect and any required execution/closure preservation.
- Check each kind-scoped non-entailment countermodel under the complete pinned theory.
- Account for all declared ordered pairs and prove role-sensitive branches; one positive example per kind is insufficient.

Inherited pending IDs: 4; ordered endpoint branches: 21.

Policy decisions: D08.
